# DevNet
A place where developers can meet and share their knowledge and experiences to others. Anyone can sign up and join the developers network while building their profiles!

A good place to show your resume. You can add your bio and experiences. Just enter your GitHub and all your recent GitHub repo will be displayed with sufficient information.

## How this works
This is an Express view engine which renders React components on server. We use the MERN stack ( MongoDB, Express, React and Nodejs) for developments.

You can view the demo of the app here : [DEMO](https://frozen-retreat-86296.herokuapp.com/)
